## Problem's remarks:
This code takes an input "n" which represents the side length of a square matrix made up of English letters. It then takes "n" number of strings as input, where each string represents a row in the matrix. The code then checks if the letters on the matrix form an "X" shape.

To check this, the code first finds the middle row and middle column of the matrix and stores it in the string "middle". The code then checks if there are more than 2 unique letters in the "middle" string, if there is more than 1 occurrence of the first letter of the first row in the "middle" string, or if the middle element of the "middle" string is not the same as the first letter of the first row. If any of these conditions are true, the code outputs "NO".

Next, the code checks if the first half of the rows of the matrix are equal to the corresponding last half of the rows in reverse order. If any of the pairs are not equal, the code outputs "NO". If all checks pass, the code outputs "YES".
## Space \ Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is O(n).
The space complexity is O(n), as the vector "V" takes up O(n) space.
# Code
```
void solve()
{
  int n;
  string s, res="YES";
  vector<string> V;
  cin >> n;
  int mid = ceil(n/2.0);
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    cin >> s;
    V.push_back(s);
  }
  string middle = V[mid-1];
  set<char> st(middle.begin(), middle.end());
  int c = count(all(middle),V[0][0]);
  if(st.size()>2 || c>1 || middle[mid-1]!=V[0][0]){res="NO";}
  else
  {
    for(int i = 0; i < mid; i++)
    {
      if(V[i] != V[n-i-1])
      {
        res="NO";
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  cout << res << endl;
}
 
```
