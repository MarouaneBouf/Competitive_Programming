## Problem's remarks:
The given code takes in a series of strings, and for each string it increments the count of that string in an unordered_map. After all the strings have been processed, it uses the max_element algorithm to find the string with the highest count, and then outputs that string.

I encountered challenges while trying to optimize the code, but it was ultimately accepted. Later, when reviewing other people's solutions, I discovered more efficient techniques, such as utilizing a LAMBDA function in the max_element algorithm to customize the comparison based on the desired outcome. 

## Space \ Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this code is O(n * log(n)), where n is the number of strings input. This is because the max_element algorithm has a time complexity of O(n * log(n)), and this code calls it once after processing n strings. The unordered_map's average case insertion time complexity is O(1) but worst case it can be O(n) if the number of elements in the map is close to the number of buckets, In that case it has to rehash all the elements.

The space complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of strings input. This is because the unordered_map stores a count for each unique string, so the space used is directly proportional to the number of unique strings input.

# Code
```
// Problem's code
void solve()
{
  unordered_map<string, int> mpp;
  int t;
  cin>>t;
  string s;
  while(t--)
  {
    cin >> s;
    mpp[s]++;
  }
  auto mx = max_element(mpp.begin(), mpp.end(), [](auto &x,auto &y)
                    {return x.second < y.second;});
  cout << mx->first << endl;
}
 
```
